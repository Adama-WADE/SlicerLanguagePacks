## Glossary

Some English words are used in Slicer with a very specific meaning. For example `volume` refers to a 3D image.
Some of these words are listed in the [Slicer Glossary](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#glossary).

When translating these words to another language, it often makes sense to not translate these words directly,
but find a word that better describes the actual meaning, and translate that word. For example, instead of translating
`volume`, it makes more sense to translate the word `image` instead.

If you encounter a word that seems to make sense to translate based on a different English word, please add it to the Glossary on weblate
by clicking on the `Add term to glossary` link on the right side of the screen and describe what word was used by adding to the explanation: `Translate as "something"`.
See for example the `glyph` term: https://hosted.weblate.org/translate/3d-slicer/glossary/en/?checksum=d948d4a61ccd080a

# Language specific instructions

## French

- Use sentence case, i.e., do not capitalize every word of a sentence. This applies everywhere, including button text, window title, etc.
  - Rationale: Title case is not common in French. macOS operating system (which uses title case heavily in English) and Microsoft Office software
    use sentence case in French localized versions.
